"""The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, 
is the suprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people.
In a group of 70 people, there's a 99.9 chance of two people having the same birthday.
But even in a group as small as 23 people, 
there's 50 percent chance of matching birthday. 
THIS PROGRAM PERFOMS SEVERAL PROBABILITY EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE PECENTSGES FOR GROUPS OF DIFFERENT SIZES.
We call these type of experiments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes,
Monte Carlo experiments
